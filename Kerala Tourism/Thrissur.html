                <h5><b>"A Keralan Festival"</b><br><br>
<p><b>Officially known as the cultural capital of Kerala, Thrissur is famous for fostering classical Keralan performing arts, religious sites and the renowned  Thrissur Pooram festival, Onam festival and Vadakkumnathan Temple.

    Thrissur is the short form of Thiru-Shiva-Per-Ur which literally means “a city with three temples of Lord Shiva”. Thrissur later became anglicised to Trichur. 
    
    Thrissur is from where Kerala gets a fair share of its festive glitter. Thrissur was the capital of the Kingdom of Kochi. The festivals celebrated here are the major attraction for tourists and a visit to Thrissur is incomplete without witnessing these. Other tourist spots in Thrissur include the Vadakkumnathan Kshetram Temple, Tomb of Shakthan Thampuran, Archaeology Museum, Athirapally Falls, Heritage Garden and many more.
