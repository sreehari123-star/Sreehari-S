            <p><i><h5>Kerala is a popular destination for both domestic as well as foreign tourists. 
              Kerala is well known for its beaches, backwaters in Alappuzha and Kollam, mountain ranges and wildlife sanctuaries. Other popular attractions in the state include the beaches at Kovalam, Varkala, Kollam and Kappad; backwater tourism and lake resorts around Ashtamudi Lake, Kollam;
               hill stations and resorts at Munnar, Wayanad, Nelliampathi, Vagamon and Ponmudi; and national parks and wildlife sanctuaries at Periyar, Parambikulam and Eravikulam National Park.
               The "backwaters" region—an extensive network of interlocking rivers, lakes, and canals that centre on Ashtamudi Lake, Kollam, also see heavy tourist traffic. Heritage sites, such as the Padmanabhapuram Palace, Hill Palace, and Mattancherry Palace, are also visited. To further promote tourism in Kerala, the Grand Kerala Shopping Festival was started by the Government of Kerala in 2007.Since then it has been held every year during the December–January period.
               The state's tourism agenda promotes ecologically sustained tourism, which focuses on the local culture, wilderness adventures, volunteering and personal growth of the local population.
               Efforts are taken to minimize the adverse effects of traditional tourism on the natural environment and enhance the cultural integrity of local people.
              Since its incorporation as a state, Kerala's economy largely operated under welfare-based democratic socialist principles. 
              This mode of development, though it resulted in a high Human Development Index and standard of living among the people, led to an economic stagnation in the 1980s (growth rate of 2.3% annually).
             This apparent paradox—high human development and low economic development—led to a large number of educated unemployed seeking jobs overseas, especially in the Gulf countries. 
              Due to a large number of expatriates, many travel operators and agencies set up shop in the state to facilitate their travel needs.
               However, the trends soon reciprocated, with the travel agencies noticing the undermined potential of the state as a tourist destination. 
               The first travel agency in Kerala, Kerala Travels, was founded by Col G.V. Raja of the Travancore royal family along with P.G.C. Pillai.
                                                              By 1986, tourism had gained an industry status.
               Kerala Tourism subsequently adopted the tagline God's Own Country in its advertisement campaigns. 
               Aggressive promotion in print and electronic media was able to invite a sizable investment in the hospitality industry.
               By the early 2000s, tourism had grown into a full-fledged, multibillion-dollar industry in the state. 
               The state was able to carve a niche for itself in the world tourism industry, thus becoming one of the places with the "highest brand recall".
               In 2003, Kerala, a hitherto unknown tourism destination, became the fastest-growing tourism destination in the world.
              Today, growing at a rate of 13.31%, Kerala is one of the most visited tourism destinations in India.<br><br>

              Flanked on the western coast by the Arabian Sea, Kerala has a long coastline of 580 km (360 mi); all of which is virtually dotted with sandy beaches.
              Boating at Paravur Lake near Kollam
              Kovalam beach near Thiruvananthapuram was among the first beaches in Kerala to attract tourists. 
              Rediscovered by back-packers and tan-seekers in the 1960s and followed by hordes of hippies in the 1970s, Kovalam is today the most visited beach in the state.[11][12][13]
              Other popularly visited beaches[14] in the state include those at Kappad, Alappuzha, Kozhikode[15] Beach,Marari Beach (Mararikulam, Alappuzha), Nattika (Thrissur), Vadanappilly beach (Thrissur), Cherai Beach, Beypore beach, Marari beach, Fort Kochi, and Varkala. The Muzhappilangad Beach at Kannur is the only drive-in beach in India. Marari beach was rated as one of the world's top five Hammock Beaches by the National Geographic survey and has been cited[16] in the international press. Payambalam beach is one of the most beautiful beach in Kerala situated in Kannur. Other beaches in Kannur include Baby beach, Meenkunnu Beach, Azhikode Beach, Madaiparra Beach, Chootath Beach, Mermaid Beach.</p><br><br>

              <img src="/pictures/battlewater.jpg"><br><br>
              <p>Main article: Kerala Backwaters<br>
              The backwaters in Kerala are a chain of brackish lagoons and lakes lying parallel to the Arabian Sea coast (known as the Malabar Coast). Houseboat or Kettuvallam rides in the backwaters are a major tourist attraction. 
              Backwater tourism is centered mostly around of Kerala like Alleppey, Kumarakom, Ashtamudi Lake, Kollam and Bekal. 
              Boat races held during festival seasons are also a major tourist attraction in the backwater regions.
              The backwater network includes large lakes such as the Ashtamudi Lake, the largest among them, linked by 1500 km of canals, both man-made and natural and fed by several rivers, and extending virtually the entire length of Kerala state.
               The backwaters were formed by the action of waves and shore currents creating low barrier islands across the mouths of the many rivers flowing down from the Western Ghats range.
              Backwaters in Kerala for honeymoon and family holidays are quite popular. 
              You may sort some of the best Kerala backwaters tour packages after reading about Kerala backwaters' reviews available on various websites.<br><br></p>

              Eastern Kerala consists of land encroached upon by the Western Ghats; the region thus includes high mountains, gorges, and deep-cut valleys.
               The wildest lands are covered with dense forests, while other regions lie under tea and coffee plantations (established mainly in the 19th and 20th centuries) or other forms of cultivation.
              
              The Western Ghats rise on average to 1500 m elevation above sea level. Some of the popular hill stations in the region are Munnar, Vagamon, Paithalmala, Wayanad, Nelliyampathi, Elapeedika, Peermade, Thekkady and Ponmudi.
              
              Kurumbalakotta Hill in Wayand is becoming a great tourist attraction now.<br><br></p>

              Silent Valley National Park in Palakkad is home to the largest population of lion-tailed macaque.<br>
               They are among the world's rarest and most threatened primates.
              
              The Konni Elephant <br>Training Centre near Pathanamthitta
              Most of Kerala, whose native habitat consists of wet evergreen rainforests<br> at lower elevations and highland deciduous and semi-evergreen forests in the east, is subject to a humid tropical climate. <br>
              However, significant variations in terrain and elevation have resulted in a land whose<br> biodiversity registers as among the world's most significant. 
              Most of <br>Kerala's significantly biodiverse tracts of wilderness lie in the evergreen forests of its easternmost districts. <br>
              Kerala also hosts two of the world's Ramsar Convention-listed wetlands: Lake Sasthamkotta and the Vembanad-Kol wetlands<br> are noted as being wetlands of international importance. 
              There are also numerous protected <br>conservation areas, including 1455.4 km2 of the vast Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve.
               In turn, the forests play<br> host to such major fauna as Asian elephant (Elephas maximus), Bengal tiger (Panthera tigris tigris), leopard (Panthera pardus), <br>Nilgiri tahr (Nilgiritragus hylocrius), and grizzled giant squirrel (Ratufa macroura).
               More remote preserves, including<br> Silent Valley National Park in the Kundali Hills, harbour endangered species such as the lion-tailed macaque (Macaca silenus),<br> Indian sloth bear (Melursus (Ursus) ursinus ursinus), and gaur (the so-called "Indian bison"—Bos gaurus).
                More common species include<br> Indian porcupine (Hystrix indica), chital (Axis axis), sambar (Cervus unicolor), gray langur, flying squirrel, swamp lynx (Felis chaus kutas), boar (Sus scrofa),<br> a variety of catarrhine Old World monkey species, gray wolf (Canis lupus), and common palm civet (Paradoxurus hermaphroditus). 
                Many reptiles, such as<br> king cobra, viper, python, various turtles and crocodiles are to be found in Kerala—again, <br>disproportionately in the east. 
                Kerala's avifauna include endemics like the Sri Lanka frogmouth (Batrachostomus moniliger), <br>Oriental bay owl, large frugivores like the great hornbill (Buceros bicornis) and Indian grey hornbill, as well as the more widespread birds such as peafowl, <br>Indian cormorant, jungle and hill 
                myna, Oriental darter, black-hooded oriole, greater racket-tailed and<br> black drongoes, bulbul (Pycnonotidae), species of kingfisher and woodpecker, jungle fowl, Alexandrine parakeet, and<br> assorted ducks and migratory birds.
                 Additionally, freshwater fish such as kadu (stinging catfish—Heteropneustes fossilis) and<br> brackishwater species such as Choottachi (orange chromide—Etroplus maculatus, valued as an aquarium specimen) also are native to Kerala's lakes and waterways.<br><br></p>
